Ray Tracing in a Summer
==========================
Ever since I discovered the power of raytracing as a pre-teen, huddled over my computer creating my first donut in Blender, I knew it would become one of my major interests. 

This summer I have tasked myself with finally learning the basics, and a little more, of programming ray tracing. My high school math teacher Mr.Fryer-Davis introduced me to this series back in high school, at that time I was afraid of C-based languages so I lost my steam. 

Fast forward to the summer of 2024, with one year of university under my belt, I have completed a course in C and feel more comfortable picking up C++. 
I see this as a good way to kill two birds with one stone, as I have an upcoming object-oriented programming course in C++. This will allow me to get a head start on learning the language.

Huge credits to Peter Shirley's [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) 
It is phenomenally written and I highly suggest anyone interested in learning the basics of ray tracing check it out!

### Features: 
- Motion Blur
